- Insights and Recommendations

## Insights:
- Revisit information fed to routing engine for trip planning. Check for discrepancies with transporters, if the routing engine is configured for optimum results.
- North, South and West Zones comidors have significant traffic of orders. But, we have a smaller
presence in Central, Eastern and North-Eastern zone. However it would be difficult to conclude
this, by looking at just 2 months data. It is worth investigating and increasing our presence in
these regions.
- From state point of view, we have heavy traffic in Mahrashtra followed by Karnataka. This is a
good indicator that we need to plan for resources on ground in these 2 states on priority. Especially,
during festive seasons.

## Recommendations: 

- Innovation: Delhivery should continue to invest in technology and innovation in order to stay ahead of the competition.
- Customer service: Delhivery should continue to improve its customer service by providing more transparency and tracking information.
- Compliance: Delhivery should stay up-to-date on the latest regulations in order to avoid compliance issues.
